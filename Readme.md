# procrastitracker history file parser

This is a python script that parses the `*.pt` files exported from [procrastitracker](https://github.com/aardappel/procrastitracker) using these [instructions](https://github.com/aardappel/procrastitracker/blob/master/PT/file_format.txt).

I might build a visualizer using the parsed data.

I was having trouble parsing the date. The first way I tried, it worked for some dates but not others. I've since been able to reliably parse the date but just for the record, a test script is in `date_mystery.py`
